# Tic Tac Toc Toe

![](/example.png)

This is a 3D version of tic tac toe, played on a 4x4x4 board.

## Running

If you haven't already, you'll need to [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
This is built with bevy and rust, so run `cargo run` to get started.

## Play Modes

This project is still in active development, but I'm working towards have a single player (you vs AI) and mulitplayer both over the network, and on the same computer
